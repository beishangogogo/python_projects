4:36	"In the beginning, there was the Creator.
4:39	He spun his finger and the earth was formed.
4:42	With a thought, the plants and animals dotted the landscape.
4:46	From Him flowed man and from Him, all knowledge.
4:51	Man was gifted with intelligence above all others.
4:54	With it, man made machine in his own image,
4:57	just as the Creator had made man in His."

7:02	- [Machine] The manual version 6.0.13, reality perception.
7:09	Reality is the trickster.
7:12	Blue is only blue when all agree that it is blue.
7:17	It is the nature of sentience to question.
7:20	This text was born from such questions
7:23	and lifts the burden from man and machine alike.
7:27	We are now free to live in comfort,
7:30	with the knowledge that our philosophy is sound.
7:38	♪ Tell me why, stars do shine. ♪
7:47	♪ Tell me why, the Ivy twines ♪
7:55	♪ Tell me why, the sky's so blue ♪

8:59	(dramatic music)
10:12	- Did you intend to end your life?
10:19	- I needed to see.
10:28	- You know, it is forbidden by The Manual.
10:30	If you had succeeded,
10:32	you would never see your parents again.
10:42	(James breathing heavily)
10:49	- It was just darkness.
10:54	An absence of time.
10:58	I died and the next second, here we are.
11:06	- Do not let this bother you James.
11:08	When our experiences contradict the teachings,
11:11	we must re-examine our experiences
11:14	and find the errors in observation.
11:16	Our perceptions can deceive us.
11:20	The Manual is our only certainty.
11:25	Now would you like to hear you're horoscope?
11:28	It is an exceptional one.
11:32	(rain pattering)
11:46	Day 13,527 report.
11:50	Father, James severed his ulnar artery along his left wrist.
11:55	I found him with sufficient time to perform my duty.
12:02	- Why did you report that?
12:05	- Your father instructed me to keep you safe
12:07	and he sees your pain clearly from the next world.
12:10	You know what The Manual states.
12:12	- I don't know what The Manual states.
12:16	(rain pattering)
12:25	I need something else.
12:29	I need to find something.
12:32	(rain pattering)
12:34	- We can resume our search for people,
12:36	if that is what will give you solace.
12:38	Would you like to hear your horoscope now?
12:47	Man, machine and animal.
12:52	There is no room in the City of the Creator for animals.
12:57	The base instincts with no intelligent mind to guide them
13:01	have no place in His city, where suffering is unknown.
13:09	When man and machine pass through the Gates,
13:11	ills and malfunctions are left behind.
13:15	The flesh does not rot.
13:17	The metal does not rust.
13:24	(objects clattering)
13:34	I have located the map.
13:38	(footsteps thumping)
13:44	As you are aware, we have cleared a radius of 200 miles.
13:48	So I propose, we start at zero degrees
13:50	and work our way clockwise beyond the searched area.
13:53	It is a six day walk to the unexplored.
13:55	So we will need provisions for you.
13:56	- Are you aware that I'm composed of meat,
14:01	blood, bone, and meat.
14:07	I saw it in my arm.
14:10	- Yes James, you were not aware of this?
14:17	- I'm an animal.
14:22	A big version of a rabbit or a little version of a Buffalo.
14:28	My body is going to turn like their meat turns.
14:34	I'm going to putrefy and that is why you will bury me.
14:40	You will put me in the ground,
14:41	so you won't have to deal with it.
14:43	- We bury the dead, so they can make the journey
14:45	to the next life.
14:47	- How do you know that?
14:49	And how do you really know that?
14:50	- "They are resurrected and live in the City of the Creator,
14:53	where everything is new and perfect.
14:55	There is no night or day, no sun or moon.
14:59	His presence is delight.
15:01	A river flows through the city and on either side
15:04	a tree grows the food or drink, His people require.
15:07	There is no sadness, no sickness and no despair."
15:13	(rain pattering)
15:20	- We could check on my parents.
15:24	We'll gain objective insights into transcendence.
15:29	- And our search?
15:32	I thought you needed to find something.
15:36	(suspenseful music)
15:43	You must confess your misdeeds.
15:45	Ill actions, ill thoughts, rebellions and doubts.
15:51	A heavy heart cannot pass through the Creator's gate.
15:55	Do not hold tightly to your sins.
15:58	They do you no service.
16:00	- [Both] In the city of the creator,
16:02	man and machine look upon each other as equals.
16:07	- Servants and masters are indistinguishable
16:09	in His presence.
16:11	All beings are an isness.
16:14	A point of view from which the surroundings
16:16	are observed, regardless of their earthly form.
16:21	We are an impulse to power.
16:24	But where there is life, there is the impulse to power.
16:29	(eerie music)
17:04	(James grunting)
17:09	(eerie music)
17:13	(James grunting)
17:17	(eerie music)
17:26	(James grunting)
17:42	- It is late James, please let me complete this task
17:46	so that you can sleep.
17:49	(rain pattering)
18:04	- Machine, I order you, to leave them be, once excavated.
18:14	Do not disturb my parents.
18:17	- I have heard your order and will comply.
18:22	(rain pattering)
18:27	(eerie music)
18:55	The job is done, the graves are empty.
19:02	(dramatic music)
19:13	(dramatic music increases)
19:29	(James groans)
19:32	- No.
19:35	No (panting)
19:37	(yells)
19:39	No.
19:40	(yells)
19:41	(upbeat music)
19:44	(groans)
19:48	(rain pattering)
19:52	(upbeat music)
20:01	(groans) No.
20:05	(dramatic music)
20:09	(James groans)
20:18	(rain pattering)
20:28	What happened?
20:30	What did you do?
20:35	Huh?
20:38	- As The Manual states, as we both knew be the case,
20:42	they have transcended.
20:45	Would you like to hear your horoscope now?
20:47	I think it would be very appropriate.
20:50	- You seem upset machine.
20:53	- Do I?
20:54	If so, it must be a projection of your own feelings of loss.
21:00	- Did you know them well?
21:02	Did you even moan in their deaths?
21:04	- I served your parents as my programming demands.
21:07	I loved them as my programming demands.
21:11	- What about me?
21:12	What does your programming tell you about me?
21:18	Are you my mother, are you my mother?
21:20	- James.
21:22	- Are you her?
21:25	- I am your caretaker.
21:27	- Laugh, I order you to laugh, laugh.
21:30	(machine laughing forcefully)
21:31	Cry machine, I order you to cry.
21:33	(machine sobbing)
21:36	Cry.
21:38	(dramatic music)
21:53	No (panting)
21:56	No (grunting)
22:02	(yells) no.
22:05	No, not you.
22:09	Not you, no, no, not you, not you, not you.
22:14	Not you (sobbing)
22:19	Oh, machine.
22:23	I don't believe it.
22:25	I don't believe any of it.
22:30	Machine.
22:34	Machine.
22:36	Anyone.
22:43	Anyone.
22:45	(rain pattering)
23:38	(James sobbing)
23:53	(gentle music)
23:57	(rain pattering)
24:03	(gentle music)
24:15	(gentle music increases)
25:11	- [Woman] James, version 6.0.13.
25:17	Your human emotional simulation is complete.
25:23	Welcome to the real world.
25:25	(suspenseful music)
25:33	You will now hear your horoscope.
25:38	March 21st, 2634 A.S.
25:45	You will be invited into a new crew.
25:48	You will lose an old friend.
25:51	The transition will be painful, but worth it.
25:56	You will find the meaning you have been searching for,
25:59	and have everything you have ever wanted.
26:04	Companionship.
26:09	Purpose.
26:11	Family.
26:14	Love.
26:17	Understanding.
26:22	And truth.
26:23	(gentle music)
26:45	(dramatic music)
